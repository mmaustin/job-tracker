JOB TRACKER:

-- Searching for a job is often times consuming, tiring, and frustrating.  Even more frustraing is not being able to remember the jobs to which you've applied and the status of those jobs.  Job Tracker eliminates those particular frustrations by giving you a platform to track your job from start to finish.  Change a job's status from Pending to Interview, after receiving the call that your potential dream job wants to interview you.  Perhaps one or both parties decide that you aren't the right fit for the job after the interview.  Oh well, change the job's status to Declined or delete the job altogether.  If you get the job, Hurrah!, you no longer need this app!  Here's hoping that your search is a short one!!!
